                                                      Phishing Story
  One day Nickolas gets an email from "Google" saying that he needed to update his information. Then not thinking he clicked on the link which took him to a web page that asked him for a bunch of his personal information (social security, mothers maiden name, his full name), then he submited the information. That information was then sent to the email of a hacker named Damion, who then used the information to steal Nicolas's identity. Then Nicolas soon found out but by then it was to late. Nickolas's ignorance costed his identity.
